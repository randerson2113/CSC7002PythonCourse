        "6.17(Project: Cooking with Healthier Ingredients) In the “Strings: A Deeper Look” chapter’s exercises, you’ll write a script that enables its user to enter ingredients from a cooking recipe, then recommends healthier replacements.3 In preparation for that exercise, create a dictionary that maps ingredients to lists of potential replacements. Some ingredient replacements are shown below:\n",

For example, if a cake recipe calls for three eggs, it might reasonably use six egg whites instead. Research conversion data for measurements and ingredient substitutes online. Your dictionary should map the ingredients to lists of potential substitutes."
